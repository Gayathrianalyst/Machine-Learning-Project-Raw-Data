## PROJECT TITLE: BANK COSTUMER CHURN PREDICTION
## Problem Statement:- As we know, it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than keeping an existing one. It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company.
**Objective:** The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the bank) or stay based on their demographic and financial features and use this model to identify high-risk customers (those most likely to churn) and take proactive measures to retain them, thereby improving customer retention and lowering the amount of money the bank spends to get new customers.
